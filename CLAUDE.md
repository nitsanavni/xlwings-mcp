Meta learn: keep CLAUDE.md up-to-date; When we discover a new way of working, a workflow, a tool to use, learning about the domain, the project, the environment, etc. please capture it in CLAUDE.md ASAP, commit and push it.
important! lint, commit, push very often
prefer `uv run` over running python directly
`./lint.sh` runs the linter, do it often please

# Notes

- list_open_workbooks returns only filenames - consider if we need absolute paths for better workbook identification
