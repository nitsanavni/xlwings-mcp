# Meta

When we discover a new way of working, a workflow, a tool to use, learning about the domain, the project, the environment, etc. please capture it here ASAP, commit and push it.

# Guidelines

- prefer uv run over running python directly
- commit and push very often
- `./lint.sh` runs the linter, do it often please
- we're using our own MCP server (excel-api) that runs via `uv run main.py` as configured in .mcp.json
