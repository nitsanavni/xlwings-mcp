Meta learn - when we discover a new way of working, a workflow, a tool to use, learning about the domain, the project, the environment, etc. please capture it here ASAP, commit and push it.
important! lint, commit, push very often
prefer `uv run` over running python directly
`./lint.sh` runs the linter, do it often please
we're using our own MCP server called 'xlwings' that runs via `uv run main.py` as configured in .mcp.json
